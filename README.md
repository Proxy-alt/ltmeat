# What this if for
This is for people who want to freeze extensions using ltmeat print.
The length of these freezes can depend on the size of the biggest file that you can access without downloading (When you visit it).
This repository shows the instructions and how to make a pull request to add more extensions. 
This repo is also for accessing extenstion files (if a file is one line I will often clean it up)

# How to freeze using LTMEAT Print
> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are a few things you will need to do initally in order to use LTMEAT Print
## First Time setup
1. Go to a new tab
2. Hit ctrl + p in order to open the print dialog
3. Next you will put the scale at 200
4. Set custom margins and put them at the corner
5. Turn on background graphics
6. Then set the paper size to a5
7. If you did everything correctly you should end up with 8 pages
You have finished setting up LTMEAT Print.
> [!NOTE]
> You will then need to do this every time you reconfigure print settings
## After First time setup
1. Find the extension you want to freeze
2. Go to the largest extension page you can find of it (it will be in a list bellow)
3. Next you will want to open the print dialog from before
4. Once it finishes loading how many pages there are you will want to hit save
5. Then hit ctrl + shift + r (hard reset)
6. And lastly duplicate the tab
7. You will then want to open a new tab
8. Then hit the extension icon (puzzle piece) next to the bar with the url
9. You will then go to manage extensions
10. Then click details under the extension you want to freeze
11. Then hit the Allow access to file URLs switch at least twice
Stuff should now be unblocked. In order for the exploit to work you must keep that tab open but do not need have it visible (you can minimize or hide the tab if wanted)
## Biggest extension pages
- Lightspeed filter agent
  - Main.js
    - Few Weeks
- Lightspeed Classroom
  - Index.js
    - Few hours
- Lightsped Digital insight agent
  - Background.js
    - Few seconds (trying to find bigger file)
# How to add your blocking extension
If your extension is not listed above or as a file you can make a pull request to add your files. 
If you don't know how to access those files I will show you how to do it.  
Assuming you have a home computer to use you will need to 
1. Add your school account to google chrome (you will need to first sign in using a personal account)
2. Then you wil go to chrome://version and see where the files for the school account are stored
3. Put that into file explorer (or whatever your operating system uses for files) at the top
4. Then go to the extensions folder
5. You will then see a lot of letters for folders
6. For this you will need to have your manage extensions page and hit details
7. Find the extension id and match it up to the one in the files
Congrats you found the files for your extension./
You will then need to make a pull request for it. To make one
1. Fork the repository
2. Add your files (make it so that its the extension name then move the extension id into that folder)
3. Then go and test to see what is the largest file you can see then add it to the list above
4. Go to pull requests
5. Hit make new pull request
6. Then hit merge
7. I will then review it then add it to the main codebase
You have now succesfully added your files.
